- <h2>Cisco-IOS-Upgrade</h2>

<b>Description</b>

I walk you through a hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer lab where I perform a complete IOS upgrade on Router0. 
This real-world simulation helps network engineering students and professionals understand the critical steps involved in maintaining and securing network infrastructure through software upgrades

✅ Identified a newer IOS version from Cisco’s database (simulated environment). ✅ Verified Router0’s hardware compatibility (DRAM/Flash) for the upgrade. ✅ Downloaded the new IOS image and placed it on a local server in the Packet Tracer topology. ✅ Confirmed Router0 had enough Flash memory to store the new IOS.
